            <p>Kwekwe Chamber of commerce shall be the name of the site. Kwekwe is a city at

            <h3>Site Purpose</h3>

            <p>The Kwekwe Chamber of Commerce eliminates the gap between the city Municipality,
                Business Environment and Social structures that exist among the different people 
                and organizations that populate the city of Kwekwe.</p>

            <p> Consider being more than just a resident but a contributing forerunner for those that will inherit
                this beautil geographic location. Understanding and taking part in regulating how the business and social ecosystem 
                of Kwekwe stands is not the Municipality's role alone.Join us in taking charge of the future of Kwekwe for our sakes
                and for the benefit of our children.</p>

            <h3>Color Schema</h3>

            <p>I will use a Midnight-Green colour for the header and footer, Black for the navigation and Tiffany-Blue  for my headings background.
